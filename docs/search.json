    "text": "Building on the work of GraemeHawker, this is a simple set of functions to pick a team for the Velogames Fantasy Cycling competition.\n\nOutline\nThe Julia package uses the Gumbo and Cascadia libraries to scrape rider data, and the JuMP optimisation library / HiGHS solver to construct and solve a mixed-integer program described below.\nAt the end of the race, each rider will have accumulated a score based on their performance, and the aim is to pick a team with the highest combined score at the end of the race. The rules are slightly difference for each type of race.\n\n\nOne-day races and short tours\nFor short races, riders are all unclassed and teams are 6-9 riders, depending upon the competition.\nThe optimisation problem can be stated as:\n\\(maximise \\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j y_j\\)\n\\(s.t.\\)\n\\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j= maxriders\\)\n\\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j z_j \\leq 100\\)\nwhere \\(j=1...n\\) is the set of all riders\n\\(x_j\\in[0,1]\\) is a binary decision variable denoting if rider \\(j\\) is chosen (1 for chosen, 0 for not chosen)\n\\(z_j\\in Z^+\\) and \\(y_j\\in Z^+\\) are the cost and score parameters of rider \\(j\\) respectively\n\n\nGrand tours\nFor grand tours each rider is classed as either an All-Rounder, a Climber, a Sprinter or is Unclassed. A team must contain 2 All-Rounders, 2 Climbers, 1 Sprinter and 3 Unclassed riders. The 9th selection can be from any of these categories.\nThe optimisation problem then becomes:\n\\(maximise \\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j y_j\\)\n\\(s.t.\\)\n\\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j=9\\)\n\\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j z_j \\leq 100\\)\n\\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j a_j \\geq 2\\)\n\\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j c_j \\geq 2\\)\n\\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j s_j \\geq 1\\)\n\\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j u_j \\geq 3\\)\nwhere \\(j=1...n\\) is the set of all riders\n\\(x_j\\in[0,1]\\) is a binary decision variable denoting if rider \\(j\\) is chosen (1 for chosen, 0 for not chosen)\n\\(z_j\\in Z^+\\) and \\(y_j\\in Z^+\\) are the cost and score parameters of rider \\(j\\) respectively\n\\(a_j\\in[0,1]\\), \\(c_j\\in[0,1]\\), \\(s_j\\in[0,1]\\) and \\(u_j\\in[0,1]\\) are binary parameters denoting if rider \\(j\\) is an All-Rounder, Climber, Sprinter or Unclassed respectively, with the further parameter constraint that \\(a_i+c_i+s_i+u_i=1\\) \\(\\forall i=1...n\\) (i.e. each rider is allocated to one and only one of the 4 categories) and by implication \\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_j+\\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_j+\\sum_{j=1}^{n} s_j+\\sum_{j=1}^{n} u_j=n\\) (i.e. the sum of the number of riders in each category is equal to the total number of riders)",
