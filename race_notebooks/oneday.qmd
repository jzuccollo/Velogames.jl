# Retrieve data

Data is scraped from the [Velogames website](https://www.velogames.com/). Rider scores are the number of points they have accumulated in the current season.

```{julia}
ridervg = getvgriders(raceurl)
ridervg_previous = getvgriders(lastyearurl)

# keep only riders in the startlist for for the race
ridervg = ridervg[ridervg.startlist.==racehash, :]

# get PCS rankings
rideroneday = getpcsranking(racesex, racecategory)

# get Betfair odds
riderodds = getodds(betfairurl)
```

## Combine datasets

```{julia}
# join all three datasets on riderkey
riderdf = leftjoin(ridervg, rideroneday, on=:riderkey, makeunique=true)
riderdf = leftjoin(riderdf, riderodds, on=:riderkey, makeunique=true)
riderdf = leftjoin(riderdf, ridervg_previous[!, [:riderkey, :points]], on=:riderkey, makeunique=true)

# drop column names ending with _1 or _2
# keeps PREVIOUS season's points. Switch to using :points for current season.
rename!(
    riderdf,
    :points_2 => :prevpoints,
    :points => :vgpoints,
    :cost => :vgcost,
    :rank => :pcsrank,
    :points_1 => :pcspoints,
    :value => :vgvalue,

cols_to_drop = [name for name in names(riderdf) if endswith(string(name), "_1") || endswith(string(name), "_2")]
select!(riderdf, Not(cols_to_drop))

# fill in missing values with a default
for col in [:pcsrank, :pcspoints, :vgpoints, :prevpoints, :odds]
    riderdf[ismissing.(riderdf[!, col]), col] .= ifelse(col == :odds, maximum(skipmissing(riderdf[!, col])), minimum(skipmissing(riderdf[!, col])))
end

# convert odds to probability of win and normalize columns
riderdf[!, :pwin] = 1 ./ riderdf[!, :odds]
disallowmissing!(riderdf, [:vgpoints, :pcspoints, :prevpoints])
for col in [:pwin, :vgpoints, :prevpoints, :pcspoints]
    riderdf[!, Symbol("z", col)] = StatsBase.zscore(riderdf[!, col])
end
```

## Calculate rider score and value

```{julia}
# weights for inv odds, vgpoints, prevvgpoints, pcspoints
WEIGHTS = [1, 0.1, 0.1, 0]
zvalues = [:zpwin, :zvgpoints, :zprevpoints, :zpcspoints]

# calculate rider calcscore as the mean of the velogames score and the PCS score
zweights = WEIGHTS ./ sum(WEIGHTS)
riderdf[!, :calcscore] = zeros(size(riderdf, 1))
for (weight, value) in zip(zweights, zvalues)
    riderdf[!, :calcscore] .+= weight .* riderdf[!, value]
end

# calculate rider value as the ratio of rider score to rider cost
riderdf.calcvalue = riderdf.calcscore ./ riderdf.vgcost

riderdf
```

# Inspect the data

## Top 10 riders by points

```{julia}
sort(riderdf, :calcscore, rev=true)[1:10, :]
```

## Top 10 riders by value

```{julia}
sort(riderdf, :calcvalue, rev=true)[1:10, Not(:riderkey)]
```

# Thumb on the scales

Set the rider score to 0 for riders you don't fancy.

```{julia}
unfancied = ["Mathieu Van Der Poel"]
riderdf.calcscore[occursin.(unfancied, riderdf.rider)] .= 0
```

# Results

## Total cost of team

Must be no more than 100.

```{julia}
modelresults = buildmodeloneday(riderdf, 6, :calcscore, :vgcost)

# total cost
riderdf.vgcost .* modelresults.data |> sum
```

## Selected riders

```{julia}
# selected riders
riderdf[!, :chosen] = modelresults.data .|> !iszero
chosenteam = filter(row -> row.chosen, riderdf)
sort(chosenteam, :vgcost, rev=true)[:, [:rider, :team, :vgcost, :vgpoints, :prevpoints, :calcvalue]]
```
