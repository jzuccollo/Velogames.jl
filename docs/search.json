    "text": "Every year, fantasy cycling aficionados meticulously pick a team of nine riders, hoping to conquer the Grand Tours. We sweat over budgets, agonize over sprinters versus climbers, and celebrate every breakaway point. But once the race is over and the winner is crowned, a tantalizing question remains: what was the best possible team you could have picked?\nThis analysis looks back at a recent Giro d’Italia to answer that question. With the benefit of perfect hindsight, we’ll use the final race results to build the ultimate fantasy team, see how it stacks up against the actual winning score, and dive deep into which riders provided the most (and least) value.",

The rules are slightly difference for each type of race.\n\n\nOne-day races and short tours\nFor short races, riders are all unclassed and teams are 6-9 riders, depending upon the competition.\nThe optimisation problem can be stated as:\n\\(maximise \\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j y_j\\)\n\\(s.t.\\)\n\\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j= maxriders\\)\n\\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j z_j \\leq 100\\)\nwhere \\(j=1...n\\) is the set of all riders\n\\(x_j\\in[0,1]\\) is a binary decision variable denoting if rider \\(j\\) is chosen (1 for chosen, 0 for not chosen)\n\\(z_j\\in Z^+\\) and \\(y_j\\in Z^+\\) are the cost and score parameters of rider \\(j\\) respectively\n\n\nGrand tours\nFor grand tours each rider is classed as either an All-Rounder, a Climber, a Sprinter or is Unclassed. A team must contain 2 All-Rounders, 2 Climbers, 1 Sprinter and 3 Unclassed riders. The 9th selection can be from any of these categories.\nThe optimisation problem then becomes:\n\\(maximise \\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j y_j\\)\n\\(s.t.\\)\n\\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j=9\\)\n\\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j z_j \\leq 100\\)\n\\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j a_j \\geq 2\\)\n\\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j c_j \\geq 2\\)\n\\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j s_j \\geq 1\\)\n\\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j u_j \\geq 3\\)\nwhere \\(j=1...n\\) is the set of all riders\n\\(x_j\\in[0,1]\\) is a binary decision variable denoting if rider \\(j\\) is chosen (1 for chosen, 0 for not chosen)\n\\(z_j\\in Z^+\\) and \\(y_j\\in Z^+\\) are the cost and score parameters of rider \\(j\\) respectively\n\\(a_j\\in[0,1]\\), \\(c_j\\in[0,1]\\), \\(s_j\\in[0,1]\\) and \\(u_j\\in[0,1]\\) are binary parameters denoting if rider \\(j\\) is an All-Rounder, Climber, Sprinter or Unclassed respectively, with the further parameter constraint that \\(a_i+c_i+s_i+u_i=1\\) \\(\\forall i=1...n\\) (i.e. each rider is allocated to one and only one of the 4 categories) and by implication \\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_j+\\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_j+\\sum_{j=1}^{n} s_j+\\sum_{j=1}^{n} u_j=n\\) (i.e. the sum of the number of riders in each category is equal to the total number of riders)",
